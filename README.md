# 📦 Foodie-Fi Case Study Analysis | 8-Week SQL Challenge

Welcome to my solution for the **Foodie-Fi Case Study** from [8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)!  
In this project, I analyzed a fictional subscription-based streaming service called **Foodie-Fi**, covering customer journeys, subscription behavior, churn patterns, and revenue insights using **SQL (MySQL)**.

## 📊 Case Study Objectives

### 🔹 Section A – Entity Exploration

- Understanding of `plans` and `subscriptions` tables
- Mapping customer behavior based on `start_date`, `plan_id`, and `plan_name`

---

### 🔹 Section B – Business Insight Questions (SQL Analysis)

Solved 11 questions such as:

1. Total unique customers  
2. Monthly trial starts  
3. Plan change trends post-2020

5. Upgrade/Downgrade behavior  
6. Plan distribution before 2021  
7. Time to upgrade to annual  
8. Percentage breakdowns across plan types

### 🔹 Section C – Payment Table Simulation

Created a **2020 payments table** that:

- Handles recurring monthly billing
- Adjusts amounts during upgrades
- Accounts for pro-rated upgrades and billing cycles
- Stops billing after churn
- Uses `recursive CTEs` and conditional logic

---
